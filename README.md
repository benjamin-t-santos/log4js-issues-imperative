To test:
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` from the top-level directory to install `log4js` and `zowe-explorer-api`
3. Launch a debug session using the "Run Extension" launch configuration. This will compile the extension and run it on a new host.
4. Note the log messages: first one ends up in the Debug console log, second one ends up in `imperative.log`
